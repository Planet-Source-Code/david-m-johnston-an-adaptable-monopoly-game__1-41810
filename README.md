### Description

A flexible monopoly game that stores all data in an Access database. It will allow the user to make alterations to both the content of the game such as property titles/prices/rents and card contents and to the appearance of the games’ user interface.

Players can buy/sell/mortgage/unmortgage property and buy/sell houses & hotels. There are also chance & Community Chest cards.

There’s no instructions or help system but I think the game is mostly self explanatory.

If you can alter 1 of the databases for another version/country etc. Please let me know and I'll include it in the next upload.

This programme won’t run at resolution of less than 800 x 600.

Please see new version "An Adaptable Monopoly Game *UPDATED*"
